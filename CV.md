## In a few words
### Academia
I recently graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) with a major in Physics and a minor in Data Science.

During this master's curriculum, I specialised in particle accelerator physics and worked for two semesters on labs at the [LPAP](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpap/) group of EPFL.

I then took interest in medical physics and how I could apply my knowledge in particle and particle accelerator physics to help cure people. I was fortunate to join the [Center for Proton Therapy](https://www.psi.ch/en/protontherapy) and the [AMAS group](http://amas.web.psi.ch/) of the Paul Scherrer Institut. 

My first task consisted of porting a GPU kernel dedicated to dose distribution computation from Java to Julia language, to then implement a new version of that kernel. That new version supported differentiability with respect to several input variables, which could be used for machine learning experiments in the frame of automatic treatment planning. 
My thesis focused on a different problem in automatic treatment planning, being the automatic selection of optimal proton beam angles for the head tumour patients.

Now I am off to new projects, where I can apply my knowledge in machine learning, data science, physics and software engineering. I am particularly interested in MedTech and CleanTech.

### Student Associations
Outside of academia, I also took part in numerous student associations. 

I notably organised the first edition of the [Nuit de la Magistrale](https://nuit-de-la-magistrale.ch/en/), the graduation party of EPFL, where I had to bring a team together and work on a whole new concept of an event. This project was full of challenges and I will remember it my whole life.

I also worked for three years for the [Festival Balélec](https://balelec.ch/fr/) where I was in charge of Site Lighting. I am still in contact with them and sharing my own experience to new members.

Last but not least, I was member of comittee of the smaller festival [Sysmic](sysmic.ch) and was part of several teams of the General Student Association of EPFL [AGEPoly](http://agepoly.ch/).
